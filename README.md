# P4 Compiler in SDN

This repository contains a presentation on the **P4** compiler in Software Defined Networking (SDN).

## Brief

The P4 programming language is a high-level language for programming the data plane of network devices. It is designed to be target-independent, meaning that the same program can be compiled to run on a variety of targets, including ASICs, FPGAs, NPUs, and software switches. This presentation provides an overview of the P4 language and its compiler, and discusses what benefits it brings to the field of Software Defined Networking (SDN).
